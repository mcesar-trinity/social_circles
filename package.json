  "description": "Updated Outstanding Issues: - Leaderboard automatic updates (including a signifier to show changes over time) - Needs an instruction page when first starting the game. - Character page information is skewed to the left (ideally would be in the center) - Design implementation is not ideal (styling, color theme, etc) - After assigning a task, create a pop up saying what happened to each character - Adding to server side functions that involve database use, and client side functions. - When adding a character we created a connection from game_character to the user_character_score and to character_likes_dislikes tables.   * For some reason inclusion (activity durability score) shows up as 0 even when entered as a different number, so that connection might need to be reviewed.   * We found the issue is that there are hanging white spaces on the character names → we weren’t able to fix this issue.",
