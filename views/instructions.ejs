            Welcome to the Social Circles game! Each turn, you are given three "circles", each with 3 characters.<br>
            Each turn, you can choose a circle of 3 characters and an action to apply on that circle. For example, 
            you could choose to "play soccer" with the first circle.<br>
            When you select one of these actions from the dropdown, each character will be either green or red, representing whether
            they like that action or not.<br>
            If you apply an action to a character who likes that action (green), their happiness will go up. 
            However, if the character doesn't like the action, their happiness will go down.<br>
            Your goal is to maximize the happiness of all your characters! <br>
            In addition, each character has an inclusion/durability value. If you don't do anything with a character for a while,
            they will get sad and their inclusion score will go down.<br>
            As you play, you will also accumulate overall player happiness. Try to get the most player happiness and 
            get on the leaderboard!<br>
        </p> -->

            <h2 style="color: #00bfff; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Welcome to <strong>Social Circles</strong>!</h2>
            
            <p>Each turn, you'll receive three "circles," each containing three unique characters.</p>
          
            <p><strong>Your mission:</strong> Maximize everyone's happiness while keeping all characters included and engaged!</p>
          
            <h3 style="color: #66d9ef; margin-top: 1.5em;">How to Play</h3>
          
            <p>Start by selecting one of the circles. Then, choose an action from the dropdown menu, such as "play soccer."</p>
          
            <p>Each character will light up to show how they feel about the action:</p>
            <p><span style="color: green;"><strong>Green</strong></span> means they like it (their happiness goes up).</p>
            <p><span style="color: red;"><strong>Red</strong></span> means they don’t (their happiness goes down).</p>
            <p>Then, you can press "assign task" to actually complete the action, and the characters' happiness will be updated accordingly!</p>
          
            <h3 style="color: #66d9ef; margin-top: 1.5em;">Don’t Forget Inclusion</h3>
          
            <p>Each character has an inclusion score. If a character is left out for too long, their inclusion score drops, and they get sad!</p>
          
            <h3 style="color: #66d9ef; margin-top: 1.5em;">Your Goal</h3>
          
            <p>Choose actions that make your characters happy. Keep everyone involved to avoid dropping inclusion scores. The more happiness you generate, the higher you’ll climb on the leaderboard.</p>
